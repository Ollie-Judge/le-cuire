               <h6>Butternut squash & sage risotto</h6>
               <br>
               <h6>Ingredients</h6>
               <p>
                  1kg butternut squash, peeled and cut into bite-size chunks
                  3 tbsp olive oil
                  bunch of sage, leaves picked, half roughly chopped, half left whole
                  1½l vegetable stock
                  50g butter
                  1 onion, finely chopped
                  300g risotto rice (we used arborio)
                  1 small glass white wine
                  50g parmesan or vegetarian alternative, finely grated
               </p>
               <br>
               <h6>Method</h6>
               <p>
                  <strong>STEP 1</strong>
                  Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Toss the squash in 1 tbsp oil together with the chopped sage.
                  Scatter into a shallow roasting tin and roast for 30 mins until brown and soft.

                  <strong>STEP 2</strong>
                  While the squash is roasting, prepare the risotto. Bring the stock to the boil and keep on a low simmer. 
                  In a separate pan, melt half the butter over a medium heat. Stir in the onions and cook gently for 8-10 mins 
                  until soft but not coloured, stirring occasionally. Stir the rice into the onions until completely coated 
                  in the butter, then stir continuously until the rice is shiny and the edges of the grain start to look transparent.

                  <strong>STEP 3</strong>
                  Pour in the wine and simmer until completely evaporated. Add the stock, a ladleful at a time, and stirring the 
                  rice over a low heat for 25-30 mins, until the rice is cooked al dente (with a slightly firm, starchy bite in 
                  the middle). The risotto should be creamy and slightly soupy.

                  <strong>STEP 4</strong>
                  At the same time, gently fry the whole sage leaves in a little olive oil until crisp, then set aside on 
                  kitchen paper. When the squash is cooked, mash half of it to a rough purée and leave half whole. When the
                  risotto is just done, stir through the purée, then add the cheese and remaining butter and leave to rest 
                  for a few minutes. Serve the risotto scattered with the whole chunks of squash and the crisp sage leaves.
